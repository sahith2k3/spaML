reservation experience direct result living parent get lot information first hand case second hand father income figure indian somewhat misleading mostly really hard proper accounting effective income true indian live genuine poverty typically consequence previous poor decision made tribe something impressed upon primary problem accounting tribal entity exists separately individual typically indian corporation one type another member tribe owns single share detail share becomes active varies tribe tribe tribe dividend paid tribal member corporation usually tune 10 30k per person depending tribe dividend money come number place primary source federal gov various business asset owned indian corporation understand couple thing first great many indian tribe run purely communist enterprise

particular tribe modest income theory actual expenditure per person annually hundred thousand dollar many borrow money future income incidentally particular case people working frequently pull hundred thousand dollar year much go back tribal corporation rather pocket somewhat annoying federal government semi regularly grant valuable asset tribe burned one previously given feasible typically selling asset american foreign company cycle continues primary problem tribe problem nutshell thoroughly pathological culture society woman reach age 16 without getting pregnant incest rape gross promiscuity rampant inbreeding heavy drug abuse pregnancy environmental factor created tribe substantial fraction tribe literally mentally retarded many thoughtful intelligent tribe member leave reservation earliest opportunity mostly avoid problem mentioned one reservation parent lived hiv infection rate 70 many society thoroughly corrupt administration law arbitrary capricious judge court police etc short many tribe still hanging together shamble become pathological society ever seen anywhere legal status really many consequence behavior many thing could tell seen probably would believe unless seen always good people tribe gotten point loser idiot outnumber good guy fair margin many time mobocracy typically btw white folk want experience overt aggressive racism minority place rule law fiction police openly thug try living one messed indian reservation give interesting perspective thing two real situation find reasonably prosperous indian first rare case tribe run disciplined intelligent people managed asset wisely second tribe dispersed assimilated part even maintain tribal identity case tribal leader reject insular behavior tends lead pathological case mentioned indian often quite wealthy technically lot money spent tribe per caput actual reportable income quite high consider many living entirely tribal dole peculiar economic structure lend well ordinary economic analysis merely looking nominal income poverty social cultural nature economic original point tangent one thing always interested concept quasi tribal corporate socialism many indian tribe implement
